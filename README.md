# iOSLearningKit

This is a place of demos where I learn new technology stacks. Previously, I carried out the code experiments in the repo [NTSnippet](https://github.com/trinhngocthuyen/NTSnippets) but it seems not reusable. Therefore, in this repo I collect them (useful snippets, solutions...) into different modules (or pods) which can be integrated via CocoaPods.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

The current code base targets Swift3, XCode8.3

## Installation

The pods are not yet available through CocoaPods.
